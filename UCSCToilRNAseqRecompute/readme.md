UCSC Toil RNAseq Recompute Compendium
* The goal of the Toil recompute was to process ~20,000 RNA-seq samples to create a consistent meta-analysis of four datasets free of computational batch effects. Using Toil, UCSC's pipeline architecture, we ran this recompute in a little over 3 days on a large AWS cluster for a cost of $1.30 per sample.
